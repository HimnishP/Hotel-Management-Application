# Hotel Management System

## Project Overview
The **Hotel Room Booking System** is designed to streamline and automate the process of room reservations, guest check-ins/check-outs, and billing operations for a hotel. This system enables both hotel staff and guests to interact efficiently with the hotelâ€™s room inventory and services.

## Features

### Staff Features
1. **Room Management**
    - Add, edit, or remove rooms.
    - Define room types (Single, Double) and set their respective prices.

2. **Reservation Management**
    - Check guests in, assign rooms, and update reservation statuses (Confirmed, Checked-in, Checked-out, Canceled).

3. **View Payments**
    - Staff can access and view all guest payments.

4. **Room Status Tracking**
    - Monitor the status of each room (Vacant, Occupied, Out of Service).

### Guest/User Features
1. **Room Search & Booking**
    - Search for available rooms based on date range, room type and price range.

2. **Guest Registration**
    - A user-friendly form collects guest details (Name, Phone Number, Email, Identification Number) at the time of booking.
    - Profiles are created for repeat guests to enable faster check-ins.

3. **Payment & Invoicing**
    - Guests can pay via debit or credit card using the system.

## Expected Output

### User Actions
- Guests can search for available rooms by date, room type, or price range.
- Guests can book, modify their reservations, and pay online.
- Hotel staff can manage reservations, check guests in/out, and generate invoices.
- Hotel staff can add, update, or remove room information, manage room rates, and generate reports.

### System Output
- Displays available rooms and updates room availability in real-time.
- Calculates and generates invoices for guest reservations.
- Provides real-time updates on room status (Vacant, Occupied, Cleaning, Out of Service).
- Generates management reports on hotel performance, including occupancy rates, revenue, and guest statistics.

## Design Paradigm
The system follows a modular approach, with clear separation of functionalities for hotel staff and guests, ensuring a smooth user experience for both parties.
